# Key Discipline. A speed-typing test app.

## About the Project

This web-based typing speed test isn't just about how fast you can typeâ€”itâ€™s about how well you can do it. Sure, you can blaze through the words at lightning speed, but if your accuracy isnâ€™t on point, you're just creating a mess faster. This app ensures that speed and precision go hand in hand.

### What Makes It Special?

- **No Distracting Real-Time Stats** â€“ Unlike other typing tests that bombard you with flashing numbers changing every millisecond, this app lets you _focus_. Your WPM and accuracy are calculated _after_ the test, so you're not constantly glancing at fluctuating stats instead of the words in front of you.

- **Accuracy Tracking** â€“ Every keystroke counts. If you make a typo, you canâ€™t just ignore it; you have to fix it. That means no reckless spammingâ€”just focused, controlled typing.
- **Accuracy Calculation** â€“ If you make more mistakes than correct keystrokes, your accuracy can go _negative_. Thatâ€™s rightâ€”typing nonsense isn't just inefficient, it actively works against you.
- **Detailed Performance Metrics** â€“ At the end of each test, you'll get your **Words Per Minute (WPM)** and **accuracy.** See where you thrive, and where you need improvement.
- **Randomized Texts from an API** â€“ No memorization tricks here. Every test presents you with fresh content, keeping your skills sharp and adaptive.
- **Intuitive UI with Real-Time Feedback** â€“ Instant visual feedback shows errors, highlights corrections, and makes sure you know exactly where you stand at every moment.

### Speed is Nothing Without Control

A little wisdom to drive the point homeâ€”this reminds us of an old joke:

> A rookie typist applies for a secretary job. The interviewer asks how fast they can type.  
> They proudly reply, "1,000 characters per minute!"  
> The employer, shocked, asks, "Really?! How?!"  
> They nod and say, "Yeah. But it turns out to be complete nonsense."

Typing fast means nothing if what you're typing is gibberish. This test ensures that speed and accuracy go hand in hand.

So, do you have the perfect balance of speed and control? Or are you just smashing keys hoping for the best? Find out nowâ€”start typing! ðŸš€
